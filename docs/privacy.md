## Usage Data

Powerlet uses a service called [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) to collect anonymous usage data.

This data is used for knowing if people are using the extension and what specific features. Examples of the data:

- 5 people in USA use the extension
- 10 people opened the extension
- 3 people clicked this button in the extension

No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.

The source code for how usage data is sent to Plausible can be found in my [Simple Plausible Tracker repository](https://github.com/anthonyec/simple_plausible_tracker).
