## Usage Data

No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected.

Powerlet collects anonymous usage data using a simple privacy focused service called [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/).

This data is used in aggregate to know if people are using the extension and what specific features. Examples of the data:

- 20 people in USA use the extension
- 30 people opened the extension
- 10 people clicked this button in the extension

The source code for how usage data is sent to Plausible can be found in my [Simple Plausible Tracker repository](https://github.com/anthonyec/simple_plausible_tracker).
